Hello Everyone! I am Michael Morgigno. I am a Marketing Major at SUNY Oswego and am beginning my adventure on learning to code. I was going to change my major to computer science, but I'm graduating next year so that would not be practical. I plan on taking my business knowledge, as well as my sekf-taught coding skills I acquire to hopefully gain a job in the programming field!
